Play

“When you asked me what I did in school today and I say, 'I just played.' Please don’t misunderstand me. For you see, I am learning as I play. I am learning to enjoy and be successful in my work. Today I am a child and my work is play.”
Anita Wadley, 1974.

There are six Early Learning and Development Areas (ELDAs) which integrate the three themes and twelve principles. The ELDAs organise children’s development and learning opportunities to help adults to organise the activities with babies, toddlers and young children.
They are:
1. Well-being
2. Identity and belonging
3. Communication
4. Exploring mathematics
5. Creativity
6. Knowledge and understanding of the world


Every child is born with rights. The following are from “The State of the World’s Children 2001, UNICEF: Section 28”:
1. Protection from physical danger
2. Adequate nutrition and health care
3. Appropriate immunisations
4. An adult with whom to form an attachment
5. An adult who can understand and respond to
their signals
6. Things to look at, touch, hear, smell, taste
7. Opportunities to explore their world
8. Appropriate language stimulation
9. Support in acquiring new motor, language and
thinking skills
10. A chance to develop some independence
11. Help in learning how to control their own behaviour
12. Opportunities to begin to learn to care for themselves
13. Daily opportunities to play with a variety of objects
14. Opportunities to develop  ne motor skills.
15. Encouragement of language through talking, being
read to, singing
16. Activities that will develop a sense of mastery
17. Experimentation with pre-writing and
pre-reading skills
18. Hands-on exploration for learning through action
19. opportunities for taking responsibility and
making choices
20. Encouragement to develop self-control, cooperation
and persistence in completing projects
21. Support for their sense of self worth
22. opportunities for self-expression
23. encouragement of creativity


Well-being therefore includes the emotional, social as
well as the physical aspects of children’s development. Well-being is very important because when children are healthy, physically active and well-nourished then they are motivated to learn.


Who are we?
We are a community based Christian day-care center and pre-school offering quality care for children aged 18 months to 6 years old, and an effective school readiness program for children entering school the following year.
Why are we unique?
Our program and educational strategy caters to fit each child’s needs.
We offer multi-dimensional education processes that prepare and direct learners through various developmental phases.
What is our aim?
We believe each child is unique, and it is our aim to produce positive, well-balanced and confident learners.
We aim to develop the child holistically and seek to empower each learner who finishes at our pre-school with critical thinking, and problem solving skills.
We strive to start the process of developing leaders that develop into capable, motivated learners that will give them an edge when starting their formal schooling years.

Christian Preschool

Early education is a perfect time to aid little ones in positively interacting with others. A key part of our daily instruction includes developing Godly character through the teaching of Biblical children’s stories. We begin our day with prayer and reading God’s word. Our students will understand the importance of being friendly and loving their teachers, classmates, family and friends. We are an extension of the home, supporting the Christian values parents are instilling in their children.

Our Environment

We take pride in providing a clean, safe and educational environment for young children and their families. Our new facility is state of the art, offering advanced technology including secured video streaming for parental viewing, biometric fingerprint scanners to sign children in and out, and magnetic door locks for secured access to our center. Our outside play area offers safe fun with age appropriate equipment and organized activities.

Curriculum
Using our Blended Learning Model, we utilize several curricular programs to engage children in developmentally appropriate learning opportunities encouraging them to be confident, life-long learners. Our learning model focuses on the whole child to meet the needs of each young Scholar.

Our Mission
To provide a Christian, preparatory preschool that promotes academic excellence and fosters an early awareness of God’s unconditional love. 

Early Education
Balanced with
Christian Values
