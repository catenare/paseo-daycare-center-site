        “When you asked me what I did in school today and I say, 'I just played.' Please don’t misunderstand me. For you
        see, I am learning as I play. I am learning to enjoy and be successful in my work. Today I am a child and my
        work is play.”

            We believe each child is unique, and it is our aim to produce positive, well-balanced and confident learners.
            We aim to develop the child holistically and seek to empower each learner who finishes at our pre-school with critical thinking, and problem solving skills.
            We strive to start the process of developing leaders that develop into capable, motivated learners that will give them an edge when starting their formal schooling years.
